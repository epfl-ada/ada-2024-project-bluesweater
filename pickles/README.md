## Pickles
This folder contains the transformed pickle dataframes we later use for analysis.

The movie_scores pickle was created from the budget.ipynb found in src/sections the Dana_Sections branch. 

cmu_imdb_tmdb_merged.pkl is produced in src/scripts/tmdb_and_imdb_to_cmu.ipynb

cmu_imdb_tmdb_wikidata_merged.pkl is produced in src/scripts/wikidata_to_cmu.ipynb
- first, create `cmu_imdb_tmdb_merged.pkl` & then `cmu_imdb_tmdb_wikidata_merged.pkl`
