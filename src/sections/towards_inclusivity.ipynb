    "2. Since we have the movie description as well as movie characters, we could identify the protagonist (perhaps the character which appears most times in a movie description) and see what the protagonists’ distribution of each race/gender/age is in each country and how it evolves over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. We could further split the characters into good and bad using NLP and classification. It would be interesting whether there is any relationship between gender/race/age and being a “good” or “bad” character.\n"
